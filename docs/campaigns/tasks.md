# Task & Reward System: Earn pOct for Contributions

OctaneSwap is committed to rewarding users who contribute to the ecosystem’s growth. Through our **Task & Reward System**, users can participate in various tasks and earn **pOct** points, which will be redeemable for **OCT tokens** at a later time (conversion ratio to be disclosed).

## Task Categories

The **Task and Reward System** is divided into several categories where users with different skills can contribute:

### 1. Development & Technical Tasks

## Earning pOct Rewards

Once you complete any of the listed tasks, you’ll earn pOct points as a reward for your contributions. These points are accumulative and will be stored within your user profile on OctaneSwap. You can track your earnings and task completion progress.

## Future Conversion

At a later date, the **pOct** points can be converted into **OCT tokens**. The conversion rate will be announced when the system is fully implemented.

**Note**: Contributions in different areas will be rewarded based on the level of effort, impact, and skill required for the task. High-impact tasks and contributions may be rewarded with higher amounts of pOct points.
