# Understanding pOct Fees

pOct implements a dynamic fee structure designed to optimize liquidity provision and trading across different types of asset pairs. Understanding how fees work is essential for both **traders** and **liquidity providers**.

## üí∞ Swap Fees

### How Swap Fees Work

Swap fees on pOct are:

- **Charged on every trade**: A small fee is taken from each trade.
- **Distributed to liquidity providers**: Fees are paid out to liquidity providers based on their share of the active liquidity in the pool.
- **Only earned by in-range liquidity positions**: Liquidity providers earn fees only when their liquidity is within the current price range.
- **Collected separately from the pool**: Fees are not reinvested automatically but must be manually collected.

### Fee Distribution

#### Active Liquidity

- Only positions with liquidity in the **current price range** earn fees.
- Fees are **distributed proportionally** based on the amount of liquidity provided.
- If the price moves outside your set range, you stop earning fees.
- Fees will resume when the price re-enters your range.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Monitoring your position is crucial for maintaining active liquidity.

### Fee Collection

- **Manual collection**: Fees are not automatically reinvested and must be manually collected by the position owner.
- You can collect fees **at any time**, with **no time limit** for collection.

## üìà Fee Optimization Strategies

### For Liquidity Providers

#### Fee Tier Selection

- **Consider asset volatility**: Stable assets benefit from lower fees, while volatile ones might justify higher fees.
- **Analyze trading volume**: Higher-volume pairs may attract more trades, but lower fees may result in higher competition.
- **Evaluate competition**: Consider what competitors are offering in similar pairs.
- **Monitor fee earnings**: Regularly assess the fees you‚Äôre earning from your liquidity provision.

#### Position Management

- **Keep liquidity in range**: Ensure your liquidity is within the current price range to earn fees.
- **Monitor fee accumulation**: Track your earnings from the pool and decide when to collect fees.
- **Regular fee collection**: Don‚Äôt leave fees uncollected for too long.
- **Adjust ranges based on earnings**: Optimize your position size and range for better returns.

### For Traders

#### Minimizing Costs

- **Choose the right fee tiers**: Select the most suitable tier based on the assets being swapped.
- **Consider price impact**: Evaluate how much the price may shift as a result of the trade.
- **Time trades during high liquidity**: Try to execute trades when liquidity is highest to minimize slippage.
- **Use limit orders**: Where available, use limit orders to control your trade execution and price.

#### Route Optimization

- **Smart router**: The pOct smart router finds the best trade paths, potentially splitting trades across multiple fee tiers to minimize cost.
