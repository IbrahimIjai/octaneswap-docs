# Protocol Mechanism

## Concentrated Liquidity Market Making (CLMM)

### Basic Concept

Traditional AMMs spread liquidity across an infinite price range, resulting in inefficiencies. **OctaneSwap's CLMM** revolutionizes this approach by allowing liquidity providers (LPs) to concentrate their capital within specific price ranges, leading to:

- **Increased Capital Efficiency:** Achieving up to **4000x** efficiency compared to traditional AMMs.
- **Reduced Slippage:** Ensuring better trade execution for users.
- **Higher Returns:** Maximizing rewards for liquidity providers.

### Price Ranges and Ticks

- **Ticks:** The price space is divided into discrete points called "ticks," which define intervals for liquidity allocation.
- **Customizable Price Ranges:** LPs choose a range defined by a lower and upper tick to concentrate their capital.
- **Efficient Trading:** Trades occurring within the specified range generate more fees for LPs.

### Fee Tiers

OctaneSwap offers multiple fee tiers to accommodate varying trading pair characteristics:

| **Fee Tier** | **Use Case**               | **Examples**        |
|--------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| **0.01%**    | Stable pairs               | USDC-USDT           |
| **0.05%**    | Low-volatility pairs       | ETH-DAI             |
| **0.3%**     | Standard pairs             | BTC-ETH             |
| **1%**       | Exotic pairs               | Rare or illiquid assets |
