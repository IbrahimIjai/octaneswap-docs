# Campaigns: Telegram Mini App for Task Completion & Rewards

OctaneSwap is excited to introduce our **Telegram Mini App**, designed to help users contribute to the growth of our ecosystem while earning rewards. The app offers a variety of tasks that can be completed directly through Telegram, allowing users to earn pOct (OctaneSwap Points), which can later be converted into OCT tokens.

## How It Works

1. **Complete Tasks**: Users can join our Telegram channel and access the mini app where they will find a list of tasks to complete. Tasks may include social media engagement, bug reporting, design submissions, or marketing outreach.
   
2. **Earn pOct Points**: Upon completing a task, users will receive pOct points. These points act as a temporary reward until they are converted into OCT tokens. The conversion rate of pOct to OCT tokens will be announced in the future, so stay tuned!

3. **Reward Redemption**: As you accumulate pOct points, you can track your progress within the Telegram app. Once the conversion ratio is disclosed, users can convert their pOct points to OCT tokens.

## Available Tasks in the Telegram Mini App

- **Development Tasks**: Assist with bug fixes, code review, smart contract development, or new feature implementation.
- **Design Tasks**: Create UI/UX designs, logos, marketing assets, etc.
- **Community & Marketing Tasks**: Spread awareness on social media, engage in community discussions, host AMAs, or build partnerships.
- **Data & Research**: Contribute with market research, analytics, and gathering relevant data to improve OctaneSwap.
