## What is Concentrated Liquidity?

Imagine you're running a lemonade stand at a summer fair. You know most of your customers will show up between 2 PM and 4 PM when the weather is hottest. Would you prepare a ton of lemonade for the whole day, or focus on making enough for the busiest hours?

Thatâ€™s the idea behind concentrated liquidityâ€”putting your resources (liquidity) exactly where theyâ€™re needed the most.

In traditional liquidity pools (like Uniswap v2), liquidity is spread evenly across the entire price rangeâ€”from 0 to infinity. While this ensures trades can happen at any price, a lot of the liquidity just sits there unused, especially for assets that have stable or predictable prices (e.g., stablecoin pairs like USDC/DAI).

With **concentrated liquidity**, you focus your liquidity in specific price ranges where most of the trading happens. For example:

- For a **stablecoin pair**, you might concentrate liquidity between **$0.99 and $1.01**.
- This makes your liquidity much more effective, earning you more fees with the same amount of capital.

## Why Concentrated Liquidity Matters

1. **Deeper Liquidity in Key Areas**  
   By concentrating liquidity in popular price ranges, traders experience less slippage and better prices.

2. **Higher Returns for Liquidity Providers (LPs)**  
   LPs earn more fees because their liquidity is always "where the action is."

3. **Efficient Use of Capital**  
   Instead of spreading liquidity thin, LPs can maximize their impact by targeting specific ranges.

## Active vs. Inactive Liquidity

### Active Liquidity

Your liquidity earns fees only when the price is within your chosen range. This is called **"in-range" liquidity**.

### Inactive Liquidity

If the price moves outside your chosen range, your liquidity becomes inactive:

- You stop earning fees.
- Your liquidity is held entirely in one of the two assets (depending on which direction the price moved).

> ðŸ’¡ **Example:**  
> Letâ€™s say you concentrate liquidity in the **$0.99â€“$1.01** range.
>
> - If the price stays within that range, your liquidity is active, and you earn fees.
> - If the price drops below **$0.99** or rises above **$1.01**, your liquidity becomes inactive until the price re-enters your range.

## Ticks: The Building Blocks of Price Ranges

Think of **ticks** as the gridlines on a price chart. They divide the price spectrum into smaller intervals, making it easier to define your liquidity range.

### How Ticks Work

- Each tick represents a **0.01% change in price**.
- LPs choose a **lower tick** and an **upper tick** to define the price range of their liquidity.

### What Happens When Prices Move?

- As prices move within a tick range, the pool swaps assets and uses the liquidity in that range.
- When the price crosses into a new tick, the system activates the liquidity in that range and continues swapping.

### Tick Spacing and Fees

- **Lower fees:** Allow narrower tick spacing, making them ideal for stablecoin pairs where prices are predictable.
- **Higher fees:** Allow wider tick spacing, suitable for volatile pairs with larger price movements.

> ðŸ’¡ **Fun Fact:**  
> Narrow tick spacing increases precision and capital efficiency. This means traders in stablecoin pairs enjoy better prices and lower slippage.
